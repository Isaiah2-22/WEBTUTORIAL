    <h5>
      JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
      <br>JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
      <br>It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
      <br>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
      <br>JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.
      <br>The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
      <br>As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
      <br>It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
      <br>However, the language itself does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.
